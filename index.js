/*  SUMMARY:
-We are using objects to group state and logic in order to keep the code more
organized. Now everything associated to a task has been encapsulated inside the
task object.

-the func newTask takes two args var title and var description which are both
properties within an object named task which is within the funcs body.
The newTask func outputs the value of the task object as its func output

-within the func is an object called task that contains a series of key value pairs

-also within the func is a method (a func within a func) called logState that
prints out a concateted string to the console if called

-below the method while still inside the original func is another merthod called
markCompleted in its body ther is code that when called will change the boolean
value of the original funcs object property "complete:" to TRUE
